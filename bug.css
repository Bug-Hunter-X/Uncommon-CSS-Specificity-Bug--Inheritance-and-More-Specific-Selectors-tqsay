The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This style is intended to override the color of the paragraph within the div */
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: inherit; /* This selector will inherit the color from the parent div but not the more specific div p selector */
}

```

In this example, even though `.special-paragraph` inherits the color from its parent `div`, the more specific `div p` selector does not apply. The `color: inherit;` only applies styles from its parent which is the `div` in this case, not considering more specific child selectors.
