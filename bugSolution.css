To solve this issue, you can use an explicit selector or combine inheritance with more specific selectors. Here are two potential solutions:

**Solution 1 (Explicit Selector):**

Avoid using `inherit` and explicitly specify the color for the `.special-paragraph` class:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: green; /* Explicitly set the color to match the most specific selector */
}
```

**Solution 2 (Combine inheritance with more specific selectors):**

Make `.special-paragraph` inherit the color from its parent div and then override it using a more specific selector to ensure the intended color green:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green;
}

div .special-paragraph {
  color: inherit; /* Inherit from div, then a more specific selector will override */
}
.special-paragraph {
  color: green; /* This will override the color inherited from div only when the paragraph is directly in div*/
}
```

By understanding and correctly managing the interplay of specificity and inheritance, you can avoid these subtle CSS issues.
